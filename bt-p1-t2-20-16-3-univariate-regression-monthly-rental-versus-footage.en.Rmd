20.16.3. Sally works at a real estate firm and was asked by her client to quantify the relationship between rental size (in square feet) and rental price. She explained to her client that the relationship is multivariate but, given that caveat, she offered to perform a linear regression with a single explanatory variable. She retrieved a massive dataset (n = 360,400 observations and includes rentals across the United States) and regressed monthly rental price (aka, the explained variable) against rental size as measured by square feet. To illustrate the units, one of data points in the dataset is (y = $1,200 per month, X = 1,000 feet^2). The results are displayed below.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(broom)

# rentals_raw <- read_csv("housing.csv")
# rentals_sort <- rentals %>% arrange(price)
# rentals_df1 <- rentals_raw %>% filter(price > 500, price < 10000, 
#                                       sqfeet> 500, sqfeet < 10000)
# boxplot(rentals$price)
# boxplot(rentals$price)$out
# 
# rentals_df1 <- rentals_df1 %>% rename(
#  "Price" = "price",
#  "SquareFeet" = "sqfeet")
# 
# saveRDS(rentals_df1, "rentals-sm.rds")

model1 <- rentals_df1 %>% lm(Price ~ SquareFeet, data =  .)
summary(model1)

price_avg_act <- mean(rentals_df1$Price)
size_ave_act <- mean(rentals_df1$SquareFeet)

new.df.rentals <- data.frame(SquareFeet = c(1000, 1500, 1800, 2000, 2500))
predict(model1, new.df.rentals)
